# reverse-proxy

nginx reverse proxy, so you can access simple webserver with foo.bar.com.  
u need DNS entry for foo.bar.com. includes self-signed crts

Idea was to use this with self-hosted nextcloud since some apps complain with about
clear text communication with server (http), but my router su**s and i cant add a local DNS entry
